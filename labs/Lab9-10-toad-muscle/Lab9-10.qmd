# Before Lab

The first week will be a group lab on toad muscle. You should develop a hypothesis that you will test the following week for your __independent lab__. 

:::{.callout-note}
# Prepare for lab by:
- Read the lab manual for this week ªs experiment \[[Lab 9/10](Lab9-10-toad-muscle-protocol.pdf)\]   
- Outline the \[[Prelab](../../labs-misc/lab-notebook.qmd#sec-prelab)\] in your lab notebook. **Summarize** the important points for this experiment.
- Draft hypotheses for each experiment
- Time permitting, outline (write a topic setence and bullet point any supporting points that come to mind):
  + Umbrella idea
  + Mechanism 1
  + Mechanism 2 
  + ...
  + end with a paragraph of your hypotheses 
- For the __methods__, outline:
  + subjects
  + equiptment 
  + experimental treatments (be sure to note what __variables__ are changing) and controls or comparisons
  + analysis
- Do Quiz on Laulima (open 24 hrs before lab) for lab 9. No quiz for lab 10.
- Please bring a laptop with you to lab, if possible, to analyze your experimental results.
- __Draft hypotheses for your independent lab__ (next week Lab 10). Get approval from your TA during lab 9.
- __For lab 10__, you will help your group members collect their data, but you will _design, execute, and write up your own independent lab report_.  
:::


## In Lab: 

- Lab 9 manual \[[pdf](Lab9-10-toad-muscle-protocol.pdf)\] . Record data in your lab notebook. 
- You should have plenty of time to complete the data collection and your figures during lab.  
- This will be a Group Lab. Begin planning with your partners as you work. 
- Start an outline with your lab partners and start outlining your discussion points, and the rest of the report. Use your time wisely to brainstorm as you work.   

## After Lab: 

- Group lab report due next week. See the guidance at the end of the manual \[[pdf](Lab9-10-toad-muscle-protocol.pdf)\]  
- Always follow the content guidelines: \[[grading guidelines](../../labs-misc/handouts/Revised_Zool430L_lab_report_guidelines.pdf)\] \[[old style](../../labs-misc/handouts/Zool430lab_report_guidelines.pdf)\]
- It is a good idea to divide up the work of writing the lab __by experiment__. That way, _each person writes a portion of the intro, methods, results, and discussion for their __hypothesis___. 
- Work out your timeline with your lab partners during lab (and plan a face-to-face meet up ___so that everyone has a chance to comment and edit___ before the lab is submitted.
