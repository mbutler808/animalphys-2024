# Pre-class materials 

::: {.callout-note}
## Read ahead

**Before class, you can prepare by reading the following materials:**

1. \[[Discussion Questions and reading assignment](../../discussions/Discussion_Week_2.pdf)\] Note that there are readings from your textbook (Withers, 1992) as well as Hill Wise and Anderson \[[(HWA)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ONGdTPdeQz2lgGgAiWyZ_yGRmmcNSwoV)\]. (These are on the shared google drive).

### Announcements/Reminders

- HW1 is [posted](../../homework/HW1metabolism.pdf)
- You should have your book. $20 from SoLS Office St. John 101. 
- Turn in your Library Day worksheet in class.
- Please friend me on Discord/ __Always tag your partners on anything group-related__
- Labs this Week - Meet at Honolulu Zoo at 1:30pm. LMK if you need a ride from campus. [Read Lab 2](../../labs/Lab2-zoo/Lab2.qmd). Bring:
  - Your lab notebook
  - A timing device (e.g. your phone)
  - Sun screen, hat, and sunglasses. It will be hot and sunny! 
  - Water

# 2a. Metabolism and how do we measure the cost of being alive?

## Discussion Questions 

1.  What is BMR and SMR? Why do we need both? What is the difference between BMR/SMR and RMR? What is AMR and MMR?

2.  What is absolute aerobic scope and factorial aerobic scope? Is it specific to an activity? Why? What are the rough rules of thumb for how much higher RMR, AMR, and MMR are above BMR or SMR for active endotherms vs ectotherms? (Look in Withers). If you knew an animal’s RMR and the types of activity it did, what strategy could you use to estimate DMR (Daily Metabolic Rate)?

![An example of Metabolic Scope](../../images/MetabolicScope.png)

3. We know that MR varies by animal size and taxonomic group. If we knew the cost of running in a 70kg human (letʻs say approximately 10x BMR), how can we use this information to estimate the cost of the same activity in a different animal?  What is the justification?

![Table 4-10 from Withers 1992](../../images/Table4-10notes.png)


4. What is direct and indirect calorimetry? Why can we metabolism by measuring an animal's heat production (think thermodynamics)?  When we try to measure metabolism by measuring heat, or O2, or CO2 -- which methods are good for aerobic vs. anaerobic metabolism?
