**Before class, you can prepare by reading the following materials:**

1. Withers chapter 5. Look over the homework, handout, and discussion questions and skim the chapter, reading anything that you need to know. 
2. \[[Discussion Questions](../../discussions/Discussion_Week_3_temperature.pdf)\] 
3. \[[Slide Deck](../../powerpoints/3.Temperature.pdf)\] - for your reference as we go through the material

# 3. Temperature

## Modes of Heat Transfer

- __Conduction__
- __Convection__
- __Evaporative__
- __Radiative__

Animals also generate heat through __Metabolism__.

{{< video https://youtu.be/BHchDrboqEo >}}



Flux = C * $\nabla$ (Mass or Energy) 

Q = C * M $\nabla$ T

Where:
- Flux is the transfer of mass or energy
- $\nabla$ is the gradient symbol
- Q is heat
- C is a material property (resistance or insulation value)
- T is temperature

## Heat Balance 

Metbolic heat production is balanced by all mechanisms for heat exchange: 

$\Delta$H$_s$ = H$_m$ $\pm$ H$_c$ $\pm$ H$_r$ $\pm$ H$_e$

Where:  
$\Delta$H$_s$ = heat of storage  
H$_m$ = heat of metabolism  
H$_c$ = heat of conduction and convection  
H$_r$ = heat of radiation  
H$_e$ = heat of evaporation  

If an animal is in heat balance, Tb (body temperature) is stable. 

If $\Delta$H$_s$ is positive,  (Gains > Losses), then  Tb increases.  

If $\Delta$H$_s$ is negative,  (Gains < Losses), then  Tb decreases.
